Consulting project on the partnership with Alibaba and the surging competitors

As companies grow and expand globalwise, it faces different competitive environments at different submarket. Starbucks enjoys globalwise revenue growth, yet its revenue in chinese market declined in the third quarter of 2018. However, it quickly launched a strategic partnership with Alibaba at different levels, for example the delivery service, the online sale of its product.
We would like to evaluate Starbucks strategy of partnering with Alibaba. To do that, we first have to take a deep dive into the competitive situation of Starbucks in the Chinese Market. In this project, we would adopt PEST analysis, Porter's Fove Forces analysis, competitor analysis and customer analysis to understand the external market situation faced by Starbucks, we are going to use data to show how China has a different drink consumption attitude and value buy-in of coffee.

Then we are going to apply internal analysis on Starbucks to desect its strength and weakness operating in Chinese market, compared with other local brands

Following up, we are going to give analysis on how this partnership with Alibaba can compensate the weakness of Alibaba in terms of customer service and distribution chain, and how we think of this strategy as a whole for the further development and expansion of Starbucks in Chinese market
